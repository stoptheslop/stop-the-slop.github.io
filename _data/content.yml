    In an era of rapid digital production, we've seen a surge in what we call "slop"—low-quality, derivative, and disposable content and software that prioritizes quantity over craftsmanship. 

    This manifesto was born out of a desire to champion the human element in creation and engineering. We believe that while technology like AI is a powerful enhancer, it should never be a replacement for thoughtful design, robust architecture, and genuine human ingenuity.

    - "AI is a powerful tool, but it should augment human ingenuity, not replace it with low-value, derivative 'slop'."
